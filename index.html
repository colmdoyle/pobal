            In 2013 when we initially built this site, we were surprised that
            such a simple idea - using your address to get a list of your public
            representatives - didn't exist on some government website. But it
            didn't, and we had the skills, so we built it. And it became bigger
            than we could have ever imagined, gettings 10s of thousands of
            visitors per month, even being used by TDs themselves.
          </p>
          <p class="text-center">
            By design, we always ran the site as a completely free service. We
            self funded all the development, the research, the maintenance costs
            etc. And that was fine. But after almost ten years, we can longer
            invest the time and resources required to do the project well. And if we
            can't do it well, then we've decided we shouldn't at all. It would
            do a disservice to the people who rely on it.
          </p>
          <p class="text-center">
            We will always be incredibly grateful for the number of
            organisations that linked to us, and trusted us to provide accurate
            information on who represents us in Ireland. Thank you for your
            support.
          </p>

            You can use
            <a href="https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/members/">this page</a> on the
            Oireachtas website to find your TDs on a map. There is still no
            website that links all county councillors, but the individual county
            council website can usually provide a list of their councillors.
